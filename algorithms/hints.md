# Task Assignments:

1. Yiting: IQL (Implicit Q-Learning)

2. Yameng: CQL (Conservative Q-Learning)

3. Sam: BCQ (Batch-Constrained Q-Learning)

4. Yujin: Result Analysis and Visualization

# Key Points & Focus:

1. Sample Size: A limited number of trajectories may lead to convergence issues. Please start thinking about potential solutions (e.g., data augmentation or specialized regularization).

2. Algorithm Flexibility: Anyone is welcome to propose and implement alternative algorithms, provided they can be executed successfully and deliver superior results.

3. Baseline Comparison: I will be developing and releasing a Baseline algorithm. If your model's performance does not exceed the baseline, you will need to review and refine your code, as it may indicate a failure in the training process.

4. Simulation Environment: I need a volunteer to help me build a Simulation Environment to evaluate everyone's algorithmic performance. Please contact me if you are interested.

5. Modeling Review: Please reach out to me if you would like to review or confirm the modeling process together.

6. Timeline: For those working on algorithms, please aim to complete your code by January 16th. This ensures Yujin has enough time for analysis and visualization and for us report writing, and slide preparation.
