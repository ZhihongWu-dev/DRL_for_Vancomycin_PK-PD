# Task Assignments:

Yiting: IQL (Implicit Q-Learning)

Yameng: CQL (Conservative Q-Learning)

Sam: BCQ (Batch-Constrained Q-Learning)

Yujin: Result Analysis and Visualization

# Key Points & Focus:

## Sample Size: A limited number of trajectories may lead to convergence issues. Please start thinking about potential solutions (e.g., data augmentation or specialized regularization).

## Algorithm Flexibility: Anyone is welcome to propose and implement alternative algorithms, provided they can be executed successfully and deliver superior results.

## Baseline Comparison: I will be developing and releasing a Baseline algorithm. If your model's performance does not exceed the baseline, you will need to review and refine your code, as it may indicate a failure in the training process.

## Simulation Environment: I need a volunteer to help me build a Simulation Environment to evaluate everyone's algorithmic performance. Please contact me if you are interested.

## Modeling Review: Please reach out to me if you would like to review or confirm the modeling process together.

## Timeline: For those working on algorithms, please aim to complete your code by January 16th. This ensures Yujin has enough time for analysis, visualization, report writing, and slide preparation.
